###MULTIMODALITY
* violin was semi modal but your are not going to produce videos from a violin
* all of a sudden a violin is a multi-modal device by the advent of digitalization


#digitality
*granular discrete - essence of digitality





#Digital
*word cloud

- discrete (i.e. not continuous)
- code/decode

* a bit is like a gate and it's either open or closed, 1 or 0
* early computers had like almost visible gates to complete (or not) the circuit
* 8 bits is a byte
*     - minimum required to complete the alphabet - 255 core characters
* computers, down to the core, have text built in





ookskool (macedonian?)
invented semiotics of insect    
- each being invents it's own sense of time and space    
- animal phenomenology    
- What does time mean to a tick
- the only thing it feels is the smell of blood and a particular warmth    


I life continuous or discrete
- haugeland says analog is impossible to define but here are some tools to help

language alphabets and musical notation
- ALL DIGITAL

rethink that idea of digital


#Slow Reading Time


##### Analog and Analog
John Haugeland    

Something that matters to humans cannot be abstracted - forgeries, even perfect ones, are unacceptable    

Only a Rembrandt is a Rembrandt    

The metaphysical anxiety of the digital is if our lives are deterministic
- religion is one thing that says there is a divine spark blah blah (counterpoint to kant for secularism)

- flawless copying?
- medium independence
- 



Most new tv's have  new technology called intellimotion
- film is @ 20 frames per second
- tv is anywhere from 25-60 frames per second
- film is a much more discrete medium in this sense
- so the smart tv's do, is counting on the idea of frames are good, they will compute halfway between one frame and the next
