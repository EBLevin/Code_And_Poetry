##Terminal Work
- review what we've learned in terminal
- expand terminal knowledge

what have we learned  
- pwd - path to working directory  
- ls lists the directories  
- "tab the world"  
- cat - list the contents of a file
- man  
- minus h flag  
- mkdir - make a directory
- touch  
- we made a temp directory in documents  
- we `touch`ed a new file test.txt  
- echo  >  
- `>` means overwrite ((dangerous))  
- `history`  
- pipe "|"  
- `nano`  
- `less` is a paginator  

you pipe the output through the pipe into a page-inator  
 `grep` is full text search
 
 `^r` is reverse search  
 
 3 commands that are scary  
 `copy`  
 ...?  
verb adverb noun  
syntax always has that structure  

**bold**

best practice is dont use spaces in the naming of the files  

dont use capitals - capitals matter
                               

`mv` 


instead of remove `rm` just create a trash folder and move shit there  

`ls -l` means list things long form

dont name things duplicatively

`!` dont need it > :)

`-r`

_flags can be chained_ 

`wget` is get something online w/ pdf link
