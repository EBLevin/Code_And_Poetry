"Philosophical Foundations of Computing"

How a computer works

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

- history of western thought

Key: dialectic between materialism and idealism

- hardware vs software

Somewhere is the ideal form of a table for Plato, rest is ephemeral

Materialist (picarus?) - it's all materiality and we should concentrate on that, do not derive abstract notion

### History of Computing 
#### And How a Computer Works

Lull - Leibniz - Boole - (Russel) - Shannon - Turing    

Ramone Lull

- religious 
- activists
**big insight** -- to think about universal language and universal truth about god

- invented way to come up with all propositions about god
- "Ars Combinatoria" (Combinatorial view)
- - literally wheels with pin

^^^ **The dream of The Universal Language** ^^^


---------


In german poetry they had a movement of combinatorial methods to create mass numbers of poems

Early pulp fiction writer's aids
- take a plot and you rotate to 


reduced vocabulary would only produce beautiful things
_________


###### Leibniz

Think of logic in terms of binary representation, not just A and B and C


###### Boole    
says you can reduce the mass number of words (operators) to just a few to improve clarity and (beauty0 efficiency

###### Russel
takes the idea of universal language into the 21st century    
- russsel's student was vitgenstein (discovered vitgenstein)    
- vitgenstein's student was Turing    


###### Shannon
take the boolean langue (including influence from Leibniz)
- says the reduced boolean set (AND, OR)
- I can take the Boolean logic and turn it into an electrical circuit

What does it mean to be "this AND this" that is an idea such that an AND gate is crossing from the theoretical to the physical, the software to the hardware


**Shannon's Contribution**    
WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THIS SHIT





limited set of logical operators    
binary encoding    
we can actually make gates and pass stuff through it the signals    





######Turing

Core concept := a turing machine can emulate any turing complete machine

[state, write, move, state]    





-----------------
universal language + universal logic = universal machine

binary + turing = ???

Transcendant mysticism can assuredly lead to violence because it does not rely upon knowledge but belief

**You have a machine that can emulate any other machine**

Code_And_Poetry_Turing


We talk all about the turing machines and the definition of the m-configuration as well


Weasel words
- very
- clearly

come up with small list of weasel words

search for the w-words in our writing (in our three papers) and replace with some substitution.


before you potentially munge you should copy and then do destructive work on the copy
