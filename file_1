create meaning out of text and not worry so much about markup

empty space matters - markdown renderers need two spaces at the end of text

- will intuit next tab

quote :: > at first line
>this is definitely a quote  
>will intuit next line - MLA standards

we care about md to word or pdf

in a md block start with yaml  
`yet another markup language`



create logic based on arbitrary metadata from the yaml block  

don't use vim necessarily, start with a more modern sleek editor



    when you use more than 4 spaces it assumes code block

**this is so fucking cool**
